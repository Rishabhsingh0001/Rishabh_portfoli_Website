            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, 
            to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island,
            then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
            His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;
            his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims 
            back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
            Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
            <br><br>
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, 
            Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and 
            Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist 
            after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his 
            career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
            Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
            In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project 
            director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite 
            in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
            In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
            <br><br>
            In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, 
            Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite
            Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.
